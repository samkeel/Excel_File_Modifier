# Excel file modifier

## Overview
This simple but powerful excel project has been an essential tool of mine for several years now.
It is a fast, efficient way to compare the datasets of two excel workbooks, highlight changes and make modifications on the source document.

The program uses the `CurrentRegion` function to create several 2 dimensional arrays of worksheets to be held in memory using the DOM method. The data being available in memory increases processing speed that can be applied to iterate, manipulate and extract data without the source workbooks being open.
